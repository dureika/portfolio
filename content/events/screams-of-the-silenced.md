*Exhibition and public program as a gesture of solidarity with Belarusian voices of (artistic) resistance protesting against a derailed dictatorship.*

Witness the historic moment of a new Belarusian society unfolding – tirelessly protesting the escalating pressures of a derailed dictatorship. To avoid persecution a clever use of language, imagery, and fill-in-the-blanks inventiveness has emerged, leading to a double art of transparency and subtlety. ‘Screams of the Silenced’ is a gesture of solidarity with Belarusian artists and all other voices of resistance in Belarus.
