The exhibition "Ales Pushkin. AFTERLIFE" will open on August 6 at 19:00 at the Museum of Free Belarus in Warsaw.

This date is not accidental: on the artist's birthday, despite his violent death, which occurred a year ago in a Hrodna prison.

The main concept of the exhibition is based on the actions and performances of Aleś Puškin, which he conducted in public spaces since 1989. These actions portray him as a radical artist-activist working within cultural, social, and political contexts.

Several key themes have been selected for the exhibition, highlighting the author's diverse art and remaining relevant in today's historical moment: Freedom Day, Gift for the President, Saints and Holidays, Belarusian Resistance, Opposition to War.

The exhibition employs the installation method of the artist himself and continues his presence in space. Most of the exhibits are created based on media artifacts, documents, and original video works from the artist's archive, friends, and colleagues. The exhibition also integrates original works from artists, photographers, and filmmakers who collaborated with Aleś and whose work is conceptually related to his ideas. This adds more insight into the atmosphere of the time and continues his artistic legacy.
